# QDNAseq setting (binsize could be selected from 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100,etc., the unit should be kb)
QDNAseq:
  binsize: 100
  # the maximum size of data running in R programme (unit: Mb)
  # for 1kb, it recommends to use at least 2 Gb (2048Mb)
  maxSize: 850
  # the number of threads in running QDNAseq, it will matter how many jobs running in parallel in Snakemake pipeline
  # for binsize <= 15kb, it recommends to operate no more than 2 jobs at a same time to avoid potential errors
  # number of jobs in parallel: total cores / threads
  threads: 3


# Rascal setting (min cellularity and other settings)
Rascal:
  min_cellularity: 0
